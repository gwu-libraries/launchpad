Nutrient trading is a market-based approach that is intended to achieve reductions in nutrient pollution and improve water quality using the most cost-effective means. Trading is an appealing option for the Chesapeake Bay because a major group of nutrient pollution contributors, agricultural non-point sources, may institute relatively inexpensive conservation practices to achieve nutrient reductions and produce tradable credits. While it is true that previous attempts to facilitate trading have been more successful in theory than in practice, trading offers several popular features that make it a more acceptable option to address nutrient pollutions than other policy alternatives. As such, trading can be a valuable tool when used in conjunction with other reduction mechanisms. Particularly in a political climate where alternative regulatory approaches are likely to be seriously encumbered, nutrient trading can advance nutrient reduction efforts and complement, or even temporarily supplement, other policy options. Despite the limitations of trading, it may be the most feasible approach in the near term considering that new, comprehensive command and control regulations of non-point sources and other mechanisms like nutrient taxes are not likely to be politically feasible for some time. To improve the chances of success for nutrient trading in the Bay, existing state trading programs must be harmonized, and trading participation must improve. Engaging interested participants, particularly agricultural non-point sources of nutrient pollution, and developing better program infrastructure now will help ensure program integration and increase the likelihood of a successful Bay-wide trading scheme in the future"--Page iii.  aAlso available in print at the Jacob Burns Law Library.  aSystem requirements:  PDF reader.  aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (viewed October 4, 2013) 0aEnvironmental policyzChesapeake Bay (Md. and Va.) 0aNutrient pollution of waterxGovernment policy. 0aNutrient pollution of waterzChesapeake Bay (Md. and Va.) 0aNutrient tradingzChesapeake Bay (Md. and Va.) 0aChesapeake Bay (Md. and Va.)2 aGeorge Washington University.bLaw School,edegree granting institution.4 zGW Law Library holdings uhttp://jacob.law.gwu.edu/search/t?=Trading%20up%20to%20save%20the%20Chesapeake%20Bay40zOnline accessuhttp://etd.gelman.gwu.edu/11297.html  a.b16072406b131018c130909  ardb 10/18/2013 rda  ainetb131018cpdeebfenggdcuh0i1
